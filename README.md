# 🏥 Healthcare Orders Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data pipeline** for analyzing healthcare orders.  
It is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Data Ingestion** – Importing and cleaning raw healthcare order data.  
2. **Data Aggregation** – Summarizing and transforming the data for insights.  
3. **Dashboard Creation** – Building visualizations to track KPIs and trends.  

The goal is to provide a structured approach for handling healthcare datasets and generating useful analytics.
